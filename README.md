#### Context
In this project, I used the customer churn data (probability) and a list of profit & revenue assumption to calculate a customer's lifetime value (CLV) over 9-year period. The customers is divided into two groups, autopay-enrolled customers and non qutopay-enrolled customers. I calculated the CLV for both groups and created a line chart to compare the 2 values. I also compared the retention rates for both groups of the customers. At the end, I suggested some marketing actions for this alarm company that can be implemented based on this customer CLV analysis.

#### Result
The analysis found that customers enrolled in autopay program had a higher lifetime value and a higher retention rate.
